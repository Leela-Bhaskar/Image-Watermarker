Python Image Watermarker
A simple yet powerful Python script to automatically add a text watermark to all images in a specified folder. This tool is perfect for photographers, content creators, and businesses who need to protect their digital assets before sharing them online.

Features
Batch Processing: Add watermarks to an entire folder of images at once.

Customizable Text: Easily change the watermark text to your name, brand, or copyright notice.

Adjustable Appearance: Modify the font, size, color, and opacity of the watermark.

Automatic Positioning: The script intelligently places the watermark in the bottom-right corner of each image, regardless of its dimensions.

Cross-Platform: Runs on any system with Python and the Pillow library installed.

Safe Processing: Your original images are kept untouched. The script saves the new watermarked images in a separate output folder.

Python 3.x

Pillow Library: The Python Imaging Library fork.

You can install Pillow using pip:

Change Watermark Text
To change the text of the watermark, modify the watermark_text argument in the function call at the bottom of the script (line 102):

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Change the text inside the quotes
    add_watermark(watermark_text="Â© Your Brand 2025")

Change Font, Color, and Size
To adjust the appearance, you can change the variables near the top of the add_watermark function:

def add_watermark(...):
    # ...
    # --- 2. Font and Text Configuration ---
    font_size = 36
    text_color = (255, 255, 255, 128)  # RGBA: (Red, Green, Blue, Opacity)
    margin = 20

    try:
        # You can change "arial.ttf" to another font file
        font = ImageFont.truetype("arial.ttf", font_size)
    except IOError:
        font = ImageFont.load_default()
    # ...
